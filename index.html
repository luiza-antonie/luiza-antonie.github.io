I am an associate professor in the School of Computer Science at the University of Guelph.  My research interests are in data mining techniques and methodology for interdisciplinary and applied research with a focus on record linkage, classification and data integration.
Before joining the University of Guelph, I finished my PhD in the  Computing Science Department at the University of Alberta, where I was part of the Database Research Group.
